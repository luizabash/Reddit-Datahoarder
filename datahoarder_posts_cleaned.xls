I am not one of them (although I wish I were) but those who’ve been DJs themselves with names somewhat known and respected in venues (local or otherwise) for 15yrs+ typically have lots of CD-R/RW written as CD-DA.

Such disks are typically obtained by the DJs from artists/producers who would give them out for promotional purposes to DJs that they trust and often contain tracks that are not intended to be released.

So, no substitution exists for the tracks found on most of such disks.

Today, except for special occasions, DJs prefer to show up at the venues with one or two USB thumb drives containing tracks for the night.

The trend is said to have started around 2009 when PioneerDJ released CDJ-2000 (which along with two later variants became the industrial standard models in venues and festivals).

Further shifting DJs away from disks to chips, additionally, are the presence of decks that no longer include CD-DA playbacks (e.g. CDJ-3000).

So, labeling and organizing thousands tracks ripped off of such disks is an essential part of the job preparation as a DJ today.

&nbsp;

1. An HBA can add both SATA or SAS HDDs, depending on the cable used.

2. If two cables (arrays/ports) are used, I could load one up with SAS HDDs and the other with SATA HDDs

3. Connecting the boot HDD to the motherboard SATA port reduces conflicts with the HBA (i.e. the HBA is only for additional non-boot required devices (DVDR, SAS HDDs, SATA HDDs, etc.) in this case)

4. The SATA HDDs would continue to require power from the PSU

5. The SAS HDDs would not require power from the PSU and would be powered by the HBA?

Then I had built myself a personal media server and wanted more content, so I got some here and there, ripping DVD and BR movies that were sitting around collecting dust.

I am somewhat confused, I did research in the past (last year) but lost my notes.

I vaguely remember that there are different storage versions for HHD (I cannot recall them though). all I remember is that higher capacity had better version.

I want to buy a new 15-20TB HHD (SSD seems pointless here) but I am not sure what brand/type to get. I have 4khdr & 1080p content (biggest video I have is around 80gb).

Normally I'd just use yt-dlp on my vps in a ssh session but taking the Patreon URL where this video is at doesn't do anything.

Using Inspect Element with Firefox (latest stable version, 130.0) doesn't lead me to any sort of link/url to a line ending with a typical video file.

I know how to download audio stuff from the Patreon audio player, it is very easy and even then, pretty much all podcasters I'm subscribed to or have been subscribed to, would post a Patreon audio player version and then in another post they would give direct download links to the podcast or whatever audio file they are sharing.

I haven't been on Patreon's site in a good while, most of my subscriptions there are for podcasts and I just grab the RSS feed from the membership section and add them to VLC player's Podcasts section where I can copy/paste the RSS feed urls and they will automatically update the list of podcasts everytime I open vlc.

Anybody recognizes what video platform this is? And if Patreon made themselves a video platform, how does one go about downloading the stuff one pays for, those aren't DRM'd files so, I understand them having the ""Save video file as..."" and ""Copy video link"" greyed out as it is behind the patreon paywall, but most if not all other people on patreon I had subscribed to always had made it easy to direct download the audio/video files they would be posting behind the paywall.

To be clear, I'm hear a LOT (SNIFFLE...Yes, I have no life! \*\*SIGH\*\*) and report a lot of threads especially those that a quick search here and elsewhere will show have been answered numerous times, if not exactly specifically, then with a little common sense and logic often be the answer. 

What's interesting is that sometimes I'll get an auto message that says my post was reviewed and found not to be against the rules, but I'll later see it was indeed removed. I'm guessing that sometimes it's re-reviewed by another Mod.   


The first part of Rule #1 covers questions such as ""What's the best NAS?, What's the difference between drive X and drive Y, and How to save files or decades""

NO requests how to find ANYTHING that's dgital. For example, how to find a lost video, ebook, etc. At the very least, posts like 

The second part of Rule #1, re-enforced by the creation of Rule #10 covers anything non-physical, such as ""Where to find Z video/e-book/file/game?""

1. Search the Internet, this subreddit and our wiki before posting

Search the internet, search the sub and check the wiki for commonly asked and answered questions. We aren't google.

Do not use this subreddit as a request forum. We are not going to help you find or exchange data, or find a deleted Youtube video. You need to do that yourself. If you have some data to request or share, you can visit r/DHExchange.

10. No requests, use r/DHExchange

No requests, use r/DHExchange for that.

The first and second part of Rule #9 is clear, NO SMART pics or ""Is my hard drive supposed to sound like this?"" 

When I point the this out in the thread, I'm sometimes countered with ""The OP wasn't asking a question, just sharing how long their drive has lasted."" Which to me falls under Rule #4 and possibly Rule #5

4. No memes or 'look at this old storage medium / Connection speed / Purchase'

r/DataHoarder is not 'look at my connection speed' or ""look at this Amazon purchase"" or ""Look at this old HDD"" or ""look at how many hard drives are showing up in my system"".

Slightly confused on how to properly approach my backup strategy with regards to critical credentials ,1,1fblfzg,https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/1fblfzg/slightly_confused_on_how_to_properly_approach_my/,7,1725755469.0,"

Recently I set up automated backup for my most important data. I bought a storage box and I am using restic for deduplicated and encrypted backups. The password and SSH private key for the box are both in my password manager which is KeePassXC. The database of my password manager is backed up as well. I also back up my 2FA app which is Aegis.

Both the database of my password manager and the backup of my 2FA app are synchronised between my PC and smartphone via Syncthing. I synchronise the latter because that allows me to automatically back it up with restic as well.

If I were to somehow lose access to my phone, that would be no problem since I could just access my PC or backup and retrieve the last backup of my 2FA app.

If I were to somehow get into the situation of losing access to my PC and phone, or my password database getting corrupted, I would be out of luck. I would have a backup of my password database it that I wouldn't be able to access.

This might sound dumb but what would be the best way to solve this potential issue? Just put the entire password database (or just the credentials required to acces my backup) into another spot I could access even if I lose both my PC and phone? Ideally, this should be at a site different from my PC.

This also made me think that up until now I though I was kind of safe with regards to my password database because it was on my phone and PC. But since it is synchronised via Syncthing, accidentally losing/deleting it on my phone or PC would make me lose it on both devices at once.

Could someone help lift my confusion around the approach I should take here?

Help with Freedom 9 Freestor 4020 Network Storage. ,1,1fbh9mw,https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/1fbh9mw/help_with_freedom_9_freestor_4020_network_storage/,0,1725743336.0,"I posted this yesterday on r/computerhelp, but really, this post belongs here. 

I picked up a Freedom 9 FreeStor 4020 network storage for $20 my local electronics recycler. I don't have any experience with any network storage or NAS-type systems, so I figured this would be a cheap and safe way for me to learn without risking expensive hardware. (Yes, I know it's very old and, in all respects, a paperweight, but it looked cool and, with the right firmware, can hold up to 4-1tb drives).

I was able to connect to it (setting IP and Subnet), but I hit a wall.

I can get to the System Setup page where, according to the[ manual (page 19)](https://www.manualslib.com/manual/240553/Freedom9-Freestor-4020.html?page=19#manual), I need to upload Firmware from the included CD. I'm inclined to think this is only with fresh out-of-the-box units, not used ones, so this shouldn't apply to me.  

https://preview.redd.it/ua447kx79gnd1.png?width=966&format=png&auto=webp&s=cffa7d8db98a76bf2341d339a46a3878b6ae2e57

After uploading the firmware, the unit resets, and takes you to the ""Welcome screen"" where you can go about setting up the NAS. (password, config, drive letter, etc)

However, I wouldn't be making this post if I had the CD or firmware handy.

I scavaged for a couple of hours, and no, there is not a single instance of the Firmware that Google or Bing could find.

Freedom 9, the manufacturer, is defunct as of 2011, and their website redirects to [Amer.com](https://amer.com/). Images of the website in [The WayBack Machine show the product](https://web.archive.org/web/20060222224200/http:/freedom9.com:80/support.php?ProductID=17), and the ability to download the firmware, but, of course, those links do not work. No fault of the Wayback Machine, they just weren't archived. 

Storage System Console, [the software that proceeds the Web interface in the manual ](https://www.manualslib.com/manual/240553/Freedom9-Freestor-4020.html?page=14#manual)still exists and [can be downloaded,](https://storage-system-console.software.informer.com/download/) but all it does for me is redirects me back to the System Setup screen; where I'm stuck. Since the NAS isn't set up, I cannot set a drive letter.

From what I can tell, the boot storage for the device is solder onto the board, yey for proprietary tech, and I'm not brave enough to try and make a dummy firmware to upload to see what happens (doubt I could also load a program like TrueNAS on something this old). 

I'm going to make the wild prediction that no one here has the CD kicking around, so is there any ideas as to how I may trigger a reset to force the Welcome Screen? Maybe something I can punch into my address bar to navigate to it?

It already has firmware loaded onto it, but there is just nothing I can do with it. Only the option to upload a firmware or shutdown the NAS. I find that really strange unless it pinged a Freedom 9 server, saw there was an update, and is now refusing to work without the update. 

The NAS came with Four 250 GB drives which are all uninitialized.

[Idiot Alert] Need Advice on Improving Media Setup,2,1fb7n63,https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/1fb7n63/idiot_alert_need_advice_on_improving_media_setup/,8,1725717817.0,"Confession: I’m a digital movie hoarder and an idiot when it comes to tech so I’m still stuck many years behind. 

Current setup: I’ve been using this setup without much complication for several years but it is breaking down. I have an 18TB drive (only half full) that stores all my data. I have several smaller drives that are 3 - 5TB that back up all the data. I use these to plug into a blu ray player so I can watch the files on my TV. As I obtain new files, I have to plug and unplug these devices to my computer and transfer the files to both the 18TB drive and the corresponding smaller drive. 

This is obviously a hassle and takes up more time than it should. 

What I’ve tried: I got a new router with a usb input. The 18TB drive is too large for it but the smaller drives can be accessed from it. This at least saves me from plugging/unplugging one drive. The problem is, my Blu ray player struggles to access that drive over the network so I can’t play the files directly. It may be an issue with the Blu Ray player or the fact that they are in different rooms. The Roku in the same room as the router seems to work fine with it.

I’ve tried using a small media player device. It seems to have trouble playing a number of the files. 

I also tried playing the files using my computer as the media server. It works but the videos lose connection a few times during one movie. Either the Blu ray player sucks for this or the internet isn’t good enough. It’s a fiber internet with 300mbps. 

My TV does not have a usb input so I can’t currently go directly to it. The blu ray player can’t handle the 18TB drive being plugged in directly either.

What I Want: I’m hoping for a relatively easy, streamlined, idiot proof solution that allows me to keep the big 18TB drive in one place as my main drive and to view videos on the TV via a wired HDMI connection. At the moment, I don’t want to invest in a bunch of new drives so I’d like to keep using the ones I have. 

What do you all recommend? Is NAS or a mini PC better? Or something else? I’m not gaming. I just want to be able to watch movies on my TV but all the options seem overwhelming and more complicated than it should be to do that simple task. Any guidance is appreciated.

I've done some research and noticed that some SSDs have a 200GB or more **pSLC cache** on a 1TB SSD m.2 drive but later on the **consistent speed** of **seq writing** drops by a lot in the mid 1000s.

My question is, how do you see this change? Some SSDs such as from Samsung or Kioxia have a smaller cache but their speeds don't drops as much relatively to competition and therefore can maintain a much higher sustained speed later on thoughout controlled benchmark tests.

Do you like the modern way of dictating SSD performance by allowing it to wield **massive caches** or do you think the old ways, such as that of Samsung with smaller cache but greater sustained speeds is the way to go for **durability/longevity, overall usage smooth experience**?

The other option i'm thinking of is HL15 from 45 drives but then i'm going to be spending a little more than 2x for the case (granted it will be quite a bit quieter).
